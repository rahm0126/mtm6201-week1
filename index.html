                    If I want to address just one fun fact, that would be that I have played basketball for more than 10 years.
                    Rather than that, just a quick biography, I am a 28 years old Persian girl that immigrated to Canada 8 months ago.
                    I studied Industrial Engineering back in my home country and I worked in different companies and industries.
                    And also my favourite hobbies are hanging out with friends, going shopping, walking and drinking coffee.
                    Worth mentioning that I like cooking different Iranian foods that I find the best in the nation's food.
